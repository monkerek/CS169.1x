BerkeleyX - Engineering Software as a Service

CS169.1x teaches the fundamentals for engineering long-lasting software using highly-productive Agile techniques to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) using Ruby on Rails. Students will understand the new challenges and opportunities of SaaS versus shrink-wrapped software. They will understand and apply fundamental programming techniques to the design, development, testing, and public cloud deployment of a simple SaaS application. Students will use best-of-breed tools that support modern development techniques including behavior-driven design, user stories, test-driven development, velocity, and pair programming. Students will learn how modern programming language features like metaprogramming and reflection can improve productivity and code maintainability. Students will work on weekly coding projects and quizzes. Those who successfully complete the assignments and earn a passing grade can get an honor code certificate or verified certificate from BerkeleyX. This run of the class includes all new videos, two new homeworks and all new exam questions.  The new class also includes embedded live chat with Teaching Assistants and other students and opportunities for remote pair programming with other students.  Group tutorial Q&A sessions will also be held and broadcast live through Google Hangouts and YouTube.
